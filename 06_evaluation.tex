As with many techniques in artistic applications of computer graphics, evaluating the
quality of a computer-generated element packing is a challenge.
The visual appeal of packings follows in part from aligning neighbouring elements along compatible 
segments of their boundaries, suggesting that they interlock by design. 
We believe that the evenness of negative space is an indicator 
on how much the elements interlock.
The separation between neighbouring elements should be roughly the same everywhere.
In the limit, as this element separation goes to zero,
the packing turns into a tessellation: a set of elements that exactly
fill a container with no overlaps.  
In this chapter, we have developed several measurements of evenness,
which allow us to examine the behaviour of manually constructed reference
packings and to compare RepulsionPak with other packing algorithms.

\newtext
{
To create a good packing, Chapter~\ref{chapter_flowpak} and Wong et al.~\cite{Wong1998} describe
a few qualitative principles should be followed: balance, flow, uniformity amidst variety, and boundary.
Gieseke et al.~\cite{Gieseke2017} suggested that symmetry is also important.
However, it remains difficult to measure these principles.
Research in NPR is lacking of evaluation, both qualitatively and quantitatively.
A few methods have been proposed for evaluating discrete texture synthesis,
but past work in evaluating packing quality is still inadequate.
}

\newtext
{
\textbf{Qualitative evaluation:}
AlMeraj et al.~\cite{AlMerajEval2003} performed a qualitative evaluation to find
the similarity between smaller texture exemplars and bigger synthesized texture arrangements.
They conducted two user studies: a pile-sorting study and a pairwise comparison study.
Kwan et al. performed a user study of 13 participant to compare Pyramid of Arclength Descriptor (PAD) with previous work~\cite{Kwan2016}.
A participant was shown a random packing and had to give ratings from 1 (worst) to 6 (best)
to each of three categories: their subjective preference, element boundary coupling, and stylishness.
}

\newtext
{
\textbf{Quantitative evaluation:}
In Jigsaw Image Mosaics (JIM)~\cite{Kim2002}, Kim et al. uses an energy minimization approach
to pack elements. They penalize a configuration if it has too much negative space,
too many overlaps, or severely deformed elements. 
Their energy minimization is useful to backtrack to previous configurations 
so that they are not stuck at a suboptimal solution.
However, they did not further discuss whether it can be used for a quantitative evaluation.
Maciejewski et al.~\cite{Maciejewski2008} compared computer-generated stipple images
with artist-made stipple images using image processing analysis techniques. %distribution
Related work in fabrication sought to cover surfaces with arrangements of element~\cite{Zehnder2016, Chen2017}.
Their packing quality is dictated by manufacturing constraints, such as connectivity, % and stability
which requires element boundaries to be connected.
If the element boundaries interlock with each other, 
more contact points can be created so that the strength of the printed object is increased.}

In this section, we first discuss distance transforms applied on negative space of a packing,
as they give us a hint of the evenness.
We also consider the idea to evaluate distance transforms only on two structures: Voronoi cell boundaries or a medial axis.
We find these structures have underlying issues, but we believe discussing them would explain our
brainstorming process in designing proposed quantitative metrics.
}

%To measure the evenness of negative space, we discuss a few plausible techniques that come into mind:
%distance transforms, Voronoi diagrams, and medial axes.
%All of them have been used extensively in shape distribution or shape analysis.
%We were initially considering to use all of them, but we explain why we only use 
%distance transforms for our evaluation and we leave out the other two.

\newtext
{
\textbf{Distance transform:} 
In the context of 2D packing, we define a distance transform as a 2D image whose pixels labelled with distance values. 
We compute a distance value $d$ as the Euclidean distance to the closest element boundary (Figure~\ref{fig_distance_transform}).
We only evaluate the distance transform on all pixels inside the negative space.
Distance $d > 0$ if $\bm{p}$ belongs to the negative space (outside all elements), 
or $d = 0$ if $p$ belongs to the positive space (inside an element).
The distance transform gives us a hint about the evenness of negative space.
An uneven distribution of elements would have significant empty patches,
causing ``high'' $d$ values locally, which appear as white ridges in Figure~\ref{fig_distance_transform}.
}


\newtext
{
\textbf{Centroidal area Voronoi diagram:} 
The spectral packing~\cite{Dalal2006} utilized a centroidal area Voronoi diagram for their optimization approach.
For each element, they aim to minimize $\sum_{\bm{p} \in I} d^2$,
where $I$ is the negative space inside the element's Voronoi cell.
That is, they seek the best alignment of every element with the boundary of its voronoi cell,
which can be achieved using a Fourier-based correlation.
However, this minimization strategy does not work well on concave elements, for example, 
Voronoi cell boundaries do not capture the hollow concavities of C-shaped elements shown in Figure~\ref{fig_cs}.
}

\newtext
{
\textbf{Medial axis:}
An alternative to handle concave elements is to generate a medial axis from the negative space.
We define a medial axis as a set of connected point, each should have more than one closest point on element boundaries.
In Figure~\ref{fig_skeleton}, Medial axis is a superset containing branches that extend to element concavities.
In theory, we can evaluate the distance transform only on pixels that belong to the medial axis to determine the evenness of negative space.
However, a medial axis contains problematic branches.
Many branches extend too far inside sharp concavities so that their ends touch (or almost touch) the element boundaries.
We also need to prune short unnecessary branches.
}

%\mynote{bad paragraph lol}
%It is apparent that a medial axis corresponds to the ridges in the distance transform.
%However, obtaining a high quality medial axis is difficult but we believe that the answer lies within the distance transform.

\section{Quantitative Metrics}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\newtext
{
Two packings must be calibrated to each other before our measurements 
can be compared meaningfully.  
We can compare packings of different sizes by normalizing their containers to
have unit area.  We must also arrange for the packings to have the same
} % newtext ends here
\textit{negative space ratio} 
 \newtext
{(the overall amount of negative space as a 
fraction of container area), so that our measurements can focus on the
distribution of negative space and not just the amount.  Given two
calibrated packings, we examine three main evenness metrics:
overlap of offset elements, spherical contact probability functions,
and distance histograms. %We discuss each of these metrics in detail below.
}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{The Overlap Function}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/metrics/overlap_metric.pdf}
\caption[An illustration of offsetting elements outward]
{\label{fig_overlap_function}
    An illustration of offsetting elements outward. The packings have $d_\mathrm{gap} / 2 = 5.7$.  
    At an offset of 5, which is slightly less than $d_\mathrm{gap} / 2$,
    the overlap for the PAD packing is 1.462\% of the total area, while the overlap for our packing is only 0.039\%.
    At an offset of 11.4, which equals $d_\mathrm{gap}$, the PAD packing shows more empty space (1.05\%) than RepulsionPak (0.07\%).
    As the offset is increased, overlaps in the PAD packing create channels
  with uneven widths, whereas ours are more uniform.
  }
\end{figure}

The overlap function is a function of a non-negative offset amount
$r$.  For any given $r$, we offset every element by computing its Minkowski
sum with a disc of radius $r$.  As $r$ grows, elements will start overlapping;
the overlap function measures the total area of these overlaps, normalized
by container area, as a function of $r$.  We can also visualize these 
overlapping areas directly as in Figure~\ref{fig_overlap_function}.  In a 
perfect packing, we would expect no overlaps until $r=d_\mathrm{gap}/2$,
our desired gap distance, at which point overlapping areas would start to
grow into channels of roughly even width.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Spherical Contact Probability}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The spherical contact probability (SCP) is the probability that a 
disc of radius $r$, chosen
uniformly at random within the container region, lies entirely within the 
packing's negative space~\cite{Chiu2013}.
The SCP can be summarized via a function $Q_s(r)$ that gives this 
probability for each radius $r$.
In order to interpret the SCP, it is helpful first to
examine a ``packing'' with perfectly even negative space (Figure~\ref{hsr_viz}a).
Consider a pattern of infinite horizontal stripes of width $d_\mathrm{s}$,
separated from each other by $d_\mathrm{gap}$.  For this pattern,
$Q_s(0)=d_\mathrm{gap}/(d_\mathrm{gap}+d_\mathrm{s})$; it is also
clear that $Q_s(d_\mathrm{gap}/2)=0$, because no disc of diameter greater
than $d_\mathrm{gap}$ can fit in the negative space
(our $d_\mathrm{gap}$ is twice the radius of the ball).
Furthermore,
$Q_s(r)$ will decrease linearly between these two points, and remain
at zero thereafter; its graph will consist of a tilted line segment
connected to a horizontal ray.

No real-world packing exhibits this SCP.  Even in a perfect arrangement
of squares (Figure~\ref{hsr_viz}b), the intersections of horizontal and
vertical channels
produce pockets of negative space that can accommodate balls of
radius $d_\mathrm{gap}\sqrt{2}/2$.  These pockets tend to raise the SCP
slightly everywhere, and cause it to bend into a small tail that
approaches zero gradually.
For a given set of elements in a container, the best packings will
have \newtext{a steeply-decreasing} SCP that stays close to the idealized stripe function most
of the way down, has a low value at $r=d_\mathrm{gap}/2$,
and then bends towards horizontal near that value.
Note that there is always a largest disc that can fit in a packing's
negative space, and hence a largest $r$ for which $Q_s(r)>0$.  
In our graphs, we plot $Q_s(r)$ only until this point, allowing us
to compare the largest empty gaps of two packings.
In less effective packings (Figs.~\ref{hsr_viz}c,d), the negative space 
will be narrower in
some places and wider in others, recognizable as a shallower SCP
with a longer tail.

\newtext{We geometrically compute SCP} by offsetting the negative
space inward.  Let $N$ be the shape of the negative space (essentially
the container region with holes where elements are).  For a given radius
$r$, we compute $N(r)$, the Minkowski difference of $N$ with a disc of
radius $r$.  Then $Q_s(r)$ is simply the ratio of the area of $N(r)$ to
the area of the container.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Histograms of the Distance Transform}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The distance transform of the negative space \newtext{provides insights} into
how negative space varies.  We could calculate a standard \textbf{histogram of the
distance transform}, but that would require quantizing distances into bins.
Instead, note that the SCP $Q_s(r)$ is precisely the normalized area of 
negative space for which the distance transform is at least $r$. 
 Looked at another way, if we offset each element by a
   radius $r$, then $1-Q_s(r)$ must be the normalized 
     area of the union of these offset elements.
% Looked at
% another way, we can offset each element by a radius $r$, in which case 
% $1-Q_s(r)$ must be the normalized area of the union of these offset elements.
This area can then be interpreted as 
a cumulative distribution function of distance.  From this observation
we can compute a continuous variant of the distance histogram as a 
probability density function via the derivative of the SCP: $H(r)=-Q_s'(r)$.

\newtext{
Given two calibrated packings, the areas under their distance histograms
are the same.  But a more even packing will have a shorter tail,
indicating a tighter upper bound on gap size, and it will have a larger
concentration of density around $d_\mathrm{gap}/2$.  In Figure~\ref{hsr_viz},
the histogram for the perfect stripe pattern is a step function that drops
to zero at $d_\mathrm{gap}/2$.  The ideal square packing has a histogram
that climbs gently until around $d_\mathrm{gap}/2$ before dropping
steeply.  The other two packings have shallower, smoother histograms.
Note also that high values of the distance histogram near $d_\mathrm{gap}/2$
correspond to a rapid negative change in the SCP, suggesting a more even
packing.

\textbf{Comparison to PAD:} 
\newtext{
Figure~\ref{pad_comparison} compares
RepulsionPak and PAD~\cite{Kwan2016}.  Packing (a) is
a result from the PAD\ paper; Packing (b) was created with RepulsionPak using
the same elements, and calibrated to have the same negative space as~(a).
Note that the PAD\ packing actually has several overlapping elements
(for example, the tooth and the horse), but white haloes around
elements artfully conceal overlaps with little degradation in
visual quality.  Our packing avoids overlaps by design.
The SCP plot in~(c) shows that our packing has a lower value at $d_\mathrm{gap}/2$,
indicating more even negative space, and has a shorter tail,
indicating fewer large empty areas.
Our result also has a histogram bump around $d_\mathrm{gap}/2$, and 
a lower overlap function.

  to have the same negative space ratio.
    Our SCP is lower and shorter than the PAD's result,
    our histogram shows higher concentration around $d_\mathrm{gap} / 2$,
    indicating more even negative space,
    and our packing has a lower overlap function.

\textbf{Comparison to an artist-made packing:} 
\newtext{
In Figure~\ref{balabolka_comparison} we show a RepulsionPak result created

Our result has fewer large empty gaps, as indicated by a short tail
in its SCP.
Our result also has a histogram bump around $d_\mathrm{gap}/2$, and a lower overlap function.

discovering compatibilities in the element boundaries and filling the space effectively.

    For comparison purposes we remove secondary elements from the artist's
  packing.  Our SCP is lower and shorter than the artist's result,
    our histogram shows more concentration around $d_\mathrm{gap} / 2$,
    and RepulsionPak also has a lower overlap function.
}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Comparison to rigid packings}: 
\newtext{
To evaluate the
effect of deformation on negative space, we compute all three metrics under
increasing values of $k_e$, the edge spring strength.  Increasing $k_e$
allows the element meshes to resist deformation, ultimately
approximating a rigid packing algorithm.  We created 15 packings,
five for each of three values of $k_e$ (5, 250, and 1000).  Each packing
used 25 elements chosen at random from a library of 60, with
no secondary elements.  
All packings are partly calibrated: they all have the same negative
space ratio, but elements are chosen at random and have some
variation in their sizes.
As shown in Figure~\ref{fifteen_packings}, a low value of
$k_e$ leads to greater deformation and steeper SCPs.
The more pronounced histogram bump at $r=d_\mathrm{gap}/2$ suggests
more even negative space.
The lower overlap functions indicate fewer narrow gaps between elements.

    The packings in (a), (b) and (c) are representative results using three values of the edge force strength $k_e$,
    from 
	rigid ($k_e=1000$) to moderate ($k_e=250$) to deformable ($k_e=5$).
% 	deformable ($k_e=5$) to moderate ($k_e=250$) to rigid ($k_e=1000$).
	We construct
    five random packings for each value of $k_e$, and plot their SCPs~(d), histograms~(e), and overlap functions~(f).
    Packings with the most deformation have steeper and shorter SCPs, 
    more histogram concentrations around $d_\mathrm{gap} / 2$, and lower overlap functions.

\section{Conclusions and Future Work}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\newtext{
We hypothesized that the evenness of negative space is an indicator
for the quality of a packing. 
Negative space between elements should be uniform in width.
we validate our deformation-driven approach using overlap functions,
spherical contact probability functions, and distance histograms.
}

\begin{itemize}

\item We would like to conduct experiments that investigate the
  extent to which quantitative measurements of the evenness of negative
  space in a packing correlate with the human perception of a
  packing's quality.  In informal evaluations, some viewers found that
  the packing in Figure~\ref{balabolka_comparison}b, created with RepulsionPak,
  was packed more tightly than the artist's packing in
  Figure~\ref{balabolka_comparison}a, even though both have the same total
  amount of negative space.

\item We would like to develop additional metrics to evaluate
  how well an ornamental design fulfills other design principles.
  A measure of element deformation in a composition would permit 
  a comparison against future deformation-driven techniques.
  \newtext{In Chapter~\ref{chapter_flowpak}, we argue that visual flow and
  ``uniformity amidst variety'' are important to attractive packings.} 
  In another study, Wong et al.~\cite{Wong1998} describe basic design
  principles for decorative arts: repetition, balance, and conformation
  to geometric constraints.  The rigorous expression of aesthetic principles
  is a fascinating area for future research.

\item Our validation metrics are all based on Minkowski sums or
  differences with discs, corresponding to a form of shape offsetting
  where corners become round.  The result of this rounding is visible in
  our graphs, for example in the gradual flattening of the SCP for
  the squares in Figure~\ref{hsr_viz}e.  It would be worthwhile to repeat
  these measurements using mitered offsetting, and to evaluate whether
  rounded or mitered offsetting is a closer match to human perceptual
  judgment of evenness.

\item When comparing calibrated packings, SCPs communicate 
  differences in the evenness of negative space, but the differences 
  between SCPs can be subtle.  In addition to distance histograms, 
  we would like to investigate other visualizations of this information
  that might amplify these differences to make evaluation easier.

\item All three metrics are only for evaluating 2D packings.
  While they extend naturally to three purely spatial
  dimensions, it is not clear whether they can be 
  adapted to the spacetime context.  
  We would like to investigate
  spatial statistics for the quality of animated packings created by AnimationPak that correlate
  with human perceptual judgments.

\end{itemize}
