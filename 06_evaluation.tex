%Understanding packing aesthetics is important, since it can make us better at creating packings or element arrangements in general.
%Our immediate goal is to develop tools that can evaluate packing algorithms and see if we make progress in packing research.
%Ultimately, we would like to understand human perception of packing aesthetics,

Understanding packing aesthetics is important, 
since it allows us to create better and more elegant packings.
%Our immediate goal is to develop tools that can evaluate packing algorithms and see if we make progress in packing research.
%Ultimately, we would like to understand human perception of packing aesthetics,
There are two ways to approach a packing evaluation. 
First, we \newtext{could} perform a qualitative evaluation by conducting user studies.
Second, we \newtext{could} develop quantitative metrics to measure \newtext{statistical and geometric features} of packings.
This chapter chooses the latter option by developing metrics
that are useful to evaluate packing algorithms, \newtext{with the goal of measuring progress} in packing research.
We see these metrics as a preliminary attempt to quantify packing aesthetics,
and we hope that our work will inspire new research in packing evaluation.

The visual appeal of packings follows in part from aligning neighbouring elements along compatible 
segments of their boundaries, suggesting that they interlock by design. 
We believe that the evenness of negative space is an indicator 
of the quality of a packing.
The separation between neighbouring elements should be roughly the same everywhere.
In this chapter, we have developed several measurements of evenness,
%which allow us to examine the behavior of manually constructed reference
%packings and to compare RepulsionPak with other packing algorithms.
\newtext{which allow us to examine packings made by real-world artists 
and to compare RepulsionPak with other packing algorithms.
Packings generated by FLOWPAK and AnimationPak are not included in this chapter.
\newtext{FLOWPAK prioritizes the flow principle over the evenness of negative space, and 
AnimationPak's spacetime packings are best left until we have developed a greater understanding of the static 2D case}.

%\nnewtext{In this chapter, we analyze packings made by real-world artists,

%\nnewtext{In this chapter, we compare artist-made and computer-generated 2D static packings.
%Specifically, we compare packings generated by RepulsionPak with other packings created

\textbf{Qualitative Evaluation:}
AlMeraj et al.~\cite{AlMerajEval2013} proposed qualitative evaluations to measure
the similarity between exemplars and synthesized textures.
They conducted two user studies: a pile-sorting study and a pairwise comparison study.
\newtext{These user studies were \newtext{concerned with the distribution of elements, without regard for the evenness of negative space,
so} their work is not suitable for our packing evaluation.}
Kwan et al. performed a simple user study of 13 participants to compare 
packings based on their Pyramid of Arclength Descriptor (PAD)~\cite{Kwan2016} with previous packing methods.
A participant was randomly shown a computer-generated packing and they had to give ratings from 1 (worst) to 6 (best)
in each of three categories: their preference, stylishness, interlocking.
\newtext{In their study,} PAD received the highest scores in all three categories.
\newtext{We see the user study could be expanded to discuss more categories, 
such as design principles discussed in Chapter~\ref{chapter_introduction}.
Additionally, their results included occasional element overlaps, which they did not discuss (Section~\ref{metric_comparison}).}
%\nnewtext{We agree that element interlocking is important but
%they did not discuss element element overlaps that present in their results.}
%However, we argue that the first two categories are ambiguous and do not give better understanding to the quality of a packing.

\newtext
{
\textbf{Quantitative Evaluation:}
In Jigsaw Image Mosaics (JIM)~\cite{Kim2002}, Kim et al. used an energy minimization approach
that penalizes a packing if it has too much negative space,
too many overlaps, or severely deformed elements. 
They did not further discuss whether their energy measurement can be used for a quantitative evaluation,
but we are inspired by their work to develop a metric based on shape overlaps (Section~\ref{section_overlap_function}).
Maciejewski et al.~\cite{Maciejewski2008} compared computer-generated stippling artwork
with artist-made stippling artwork using the Gray-Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM),
which measures spatial relationships between pixel intensities.
GLCM works best for analyzing dense point distributions, \newtext{and} it unfortunately cannot be used to analyze arrangements with larger shapes.
In medical research, Aliy et al.~\cite{Aliy2013} proposed a method to analyze the arrangement of 
small biological objects in \newtext{a histology} image.
They treated these objects as a point distribution by computing their centroids, 
\newtext{and computed the spatial relationships of these centroids}, 
so their work is unsuitable for our research.
In fabrication, the packing quality is dictated by manufacturing constraints, such as connectivity,
so that printed objects can resist from breaking~\cite{Chen2016, Zehnder2016, Martinez2019}.
However, our objective is more about the evenness of negative space and less about connectivity strengths.

%In this section, we discuss distance transforms applied on the negative space as they give us a hint of the evenness.
%We also considered an idea of augment distance transforms with two structures: Centroidal area Voronoi diagram and medial axes,
%as they bisect the gaps of negative space.
%In the end we discarded the idea, and this section explains why both structures have underlying issues 
%so that we have to come up with the proposed quantitative metrics.

%\newtext

%\textbf{Distance Transform:} 
%In the context of 2D packing, we define a distance transform as a 2D image whose pixels labelled with distance values. 
%We compute a distance value $d$ as the Euclidean distance to the closest element boundary (Figure~\ref{fig_distance_transform}).
%We only evaluate the distance transform on all pixels inside the negative space.
%Distance $d > 0$ if $\bm{p}$ belongs to the negative space (outside all elements), 
%or $d = 0$ if $p$ belongs to the positive space (inside an element).
%The distance transform gives us a hint about the evenness of negative space.
%An uneven distribution of elements would have significant empty patches,
%causing ``high'' $d$ values locally, which appear as white ridges in Figure~\ref{fig_distance_transform}.
%These ridges are the local maxima of the distance transform. 
%To evaluate the evenness of negative space we can evaluate the values of all local maxima, 
%however, it is not an easy task because the value term of ``local''.
%}


%\newtext
%{
%All $d$ values on the Voronoi cell boundaries can be considered local.
%The spectral packing~\cite{Dalal2006} utilized a centroidal area Voronoi diagram for their optimization approach.
%For each element, they aim to minimize $\sum_{\bm{p} \in I} d^2$,
%where $I$ is the negative space inside the element's Voronoi cell.
%That is, they seek the best alignment of every element with the boundary of its voronoi cell,
%which can be achieved using a Fourier-based correlation.
%However, Voronoi cell boundaries cannot capture local maxima that is created by concave elements,
%hollow concavities of C-shaped elements shown in Figure~\ref{fig_cs} are left out.
%}

%\newtext
%{
%An alternative to handle concave elements is to generate a medial axis from the negative space.
%We define a medial axis as a set of connected point, each should have more than one closest point on element boundaries.
%In Figure~\ref{fig_skeleton}, Medial axis is a superset containing branches that extend to element concavities.
%A medial axis does seem to capture more local maxima than Voronoi cell boundaries.
%However, a medial axis contains problematic branches.
%Many branches extend too far inside sharp concavities so that their ends touch (or almost touch) the element boundaries.
%We also need to prune short unnecessary branches.

\section{Quantitative Metrics}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%We develop metrics that can reveal the characteristic of the negative space of a packing.
\newtext{We develop metrics that summarize the distribution \newtext{of} negative space as a data visualization consisting of 2D functions.
By generating and displaying these functions, 
we can compare multiple packings.
These metrics do not \newtext{apply to tilings, in which elements interlock perfectly}.
\newtext{They} also do not attempt to quantify the aesthetics of discrete textures since they
do not analyze the positive space distribution.
%Our metrics attempt to quantify element interlocking indirectly through an analysis of evenness of negative space.
%These metrics also cannot analyze tilings with perfect arrangements or the distributions of positive space.

\subsection{Spherical Contact Probability}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The spherical contact probability (SCP) is the probability that a 
disc of radius $r$, chosen
uniformly at random within the container region, lies entirely within the 
packing's negative space~\cite{Chiu2013}.
The SCP can be summarized via a function $Q_s(r)$ that gives this 
probability for each radius $r$.
\newtext{Figure~\ref{fig_unilever_scp} shows an \newtext{example of a typical} $Q_s(r)$, 
\newtext{showing it to be} a decreasing monotonic function.}
In order to interpret the SCP, it is helpful first to
examine a ``packing'' with perfectly even negative space (Figure~\ref{hsr_viz}a).
Consider a pattern of infinite horizontal stripes of width $d_\mathrm{s}$,
\newtext{separated from each other by negative space of width $d_\mathrm{gap}$}.  For this pattern,
$Q_s(0)=d_\mathrm{gap}/(d_\mathrm{gap}+d_\mathrm{s})$; it is also
clear that $Q_s(d_\mathrm{gap}/2)=0$, because no disc of diameter greater
than $d_\mathrm{gap}$ can fit in the negative space
(our $d_\mathrm{gap}$ is twice the radius of the ball).
Furthermore,
$Q_s(r)$ will decrease linearly between these two points, and remain
at zero thereafter; its graph will consist of a tilted line segment
connected to a horizontal ray.




No real-world packing exhibits this SCP.  Even in a perfect arrangement
of squares (Figure~\ref{hsr_viz}b), the intersections of horizontal and
vertical channels
produce pockets of negative space that can accommodate balls of
radius $d_\mathrm{gap}\sqrt{2}/2$.  These pockets tend to raise the SCP
slightly everywhere, and cause it to bend into a small tail that
approaches zero gradually.
For a given set of elements in a container, the best packings will
have a steeply-decreasing SCP that stays close to the idealized stripe function most
of the way down, has a low value at $r=d_\mathrm{gap}/2$,
and then bends towards horizontal near that value.
Note that there is always a largest disc that can fit in a packing's
negative space, and hence a largest $r$ for which $Q_s(r)>0$.  
In our graphs, we plot $Q_s(r)$ only until this point, allowing us
to compare the largest empty gaps of two packings.
In less effective packings (Figs.~\ref{hsr_viz}c,d), the negative space 
will be narrower in
some places and wider in others, recognizable as a shallower SCP
with a longer tail.

\newtext{\newtext{The} SCP is expressed in \newtext{terms} of probabilities as it originates from spatial statistics.
However, it also has a simple geometric interpretation that leads naturally to a simpler and more precise computation.}
We geometrically compute the SCP by offsetting the negative
space inward.  Let $N$ be the shape of the negative space (essentially
the container region with holes where elements are).  For a given radius
$r$, we compute $N(r)$, the Minkowski difference of $N$ with a disc of
radius $r$.  Then $Q_s(r)$ is simply the ratio of the area of $N(r)$ to
the area of the container.
\newtext{Figure~\ref{fig_unilever_scp} shows the illustration of the geometric interpretation of the SCP.}

	with the container area (drawn \newtext{in grey}).

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\newtext
{
In the context of 2D packings, a distance transform is a scalar field located in the negative space where every point
contains the distance $r$ value to the nearest \newtext{point on the boundary of an} element.
Note that the value $r$ can also be interpreted as the disc radius in SCP.
\newtext{In practice, we construct a discrete approximation of the distance transform in a uniform 2D grid 
by computing this distance for the centre of every grid cell.}
The computation can be accelerated by storing the element boundaries inside a quadtree.
An alternative approach is a level-set method that propagates the fronts of the element boundaries~\cite{Osher1988}.
Figure~\ref{fig_distance_transform} shows an example of a discrete distance transform,
where lighter pixel colours represent higher $r$ values.

\newtext{
The distance transform of the negative space provides insights into how negative space varies. 
In the context of 2D packings, a distance transform is a 2D image where each pixel
contains the radius $r$ value to the nearest element.
Figure~\ref{fig_distance_transform} shows an example for a distance transform,
lighter a color of a pixel, higher the $r$ value. %, showing a pattern of white ridges
%that correspond to a medial axis.
We investigated the idea of analyzing $r$ values only on a medial axis 
since it bisects the gaps of negative space.
%since they can be considered as the widths of negative space gaps.
However, the challenge is to prune a significant number of medial axis's problematic branches
that are either too long or too short, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig_skeleton}.

%{As creating a high quality medial axis is difficult,
%we decide to analyze the entire negative space by computing the histogram of the distance transform.}
%{A histogram of all $r$ values is a better way to analyze the distance transform.}
%{We decide to analyze the entire negative space by generating a histogram of all $r$ values.}
%The distance transform of the negative space can 
%provide insights into how negative space varies
%We could calculate a standard \textbf{histogram of the
%distance transform}, 
%but that would require quantizing \newtext{$r$ values} into bins.


The histogram of a distance transform provides insights into how negative space varies. 
However, this would require quantizing \newtext{distance values} into bins.
Instead, note that the SCP $Q_s(r)$ is precisely the normalized area of 
negative space for which the distance transform is at least $r$. 
Looked at another way, if we offset each element by a
radius $r$, then $1-Q_s(r)$ must be the normalized 
area of the union of these offset elements.
% Looked at
% another way, we can offset each element by a radius $r$, in which case 
% $1-Q_s(r)$ must be the normalized area of the union of these offset elements.
This area can then be interpreted as 
a cumulative distribution function of distance.  From this observation
we can compute a continuous variant of the distance histogram as a 
probability density function via the derivative of the SCP: $H(r)=-Q_s'(r)$.


\newtext{Given two packings with the same negative space area, }
the areas under their distance histograms
are the same.  But a more even packing will have a shorter tail,
indicating a tighter upper bound on gap size, and it will have a larger
concentration of density around $d_\mathrm{gap}/2$.  In Figure~\ref{hsr_viz},
the histogram for the perfect stripe pattern is a step function that drops
to zero at $d_\mathrm{gap}/2$.  The ideal square packing has a histogram
that climbs gently until around $d_\mathrm{gap}/2$ before dropping
steeply.  The other two packings have shallower, smoother histograms.
Note also that high values of the distance histogram near $d_\mathrm{gap}/2$
correspond to a rapid negative change in the SCP, suggesting a more even
packing.

\subsection{The Overlap Function}
\label{section_overlap_function}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{figures/metrics/overlap_metric.pdf}
\caption[An illustration of offsetting elements outward]
{\label{fig_overlap_function}
    An illustration of offsetting elements outward. The packings have $d_\mathrm{gap} / 2 = 5.7$.  
    At an offset of 5, which is slightly less than $d_\mathrm{gap} / 2$,
    the overlap for the PAD packing is 1.462\% of the total area, while the overlap for our packing is only 0.039\%.
    At an offset of 11.4, which equals $d_\mathrm{gap}$, the PAD packing shows more empty space (1.05\%) than RepulsionPak (0.07\%).
    As the offset is increased, overlaps in the PAD packing create channels
  with uneven widths, whereas ours are more uniform.
  \newtext{The corresponding overlap function is shown in Figure~\ref{pad_comparison}e}.
  }
\end{figure}

The overlap function is a function of a non-negative offset amount
$r$.  For any given $r$, we offset every element by computing its Minkowski
sum with a disc of radius $r$.  As $r$ grows, elements will start overlapping;
the overlap function measures the total area of these overlaps, normalized
by container area, as a function of $r$.  We can also visualize these 
overlapping areas directly as in Figure~\ref{fig_overlap_function}.  In a 
perfect packing, we would expect no overlaps until $r=d_\mathrm{gap}/2$,
our desired gap distance, at which point overlapping areas would start to
grow into channels of roughly even width.

\section{Comparisons}
\label{metric_comparison}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\newtext{This section compares various 2D packings using three metrics discussed previously.
Our comparisons are limited to static 2D packings that have clear boundaries
between positive space and negative space.}
%\newtext{For all comparisons below, 
%we estimate $d_\mathrm{gap}/2$ as the average of skin widths of all elements 
%in a RepulsionPak packing after the simulation stops.
%\newtext{As discussed in Section~\ref{repulsionpak_preprocessing},
%the value $d_\mathrm{gap}$ is the gap between two elements.
%}
%}


\textbf{Calibration:}
\newtext{Two or more packings} must be calibrated to each other before they
\nnewtext{can be} compared meaningfully.  
The calibration process requires packings to satisfy these conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \newtext{All packings should use an identical container shape. We then normalize the container to have unit area.}

\item \newtext{We must arrange for the packings to have the same
\textit{negative space ratio} 
(the overall amount of negative space as a fraction of container area), 
in order to permit fair comparisons of the distributions of that negative space.}

\item \newtext{All packings should have the same set of elements, ensuring the difficulty of the packing process remains the same.}

\item \newtext{All packings should have the same element relative sizes,
as changing the size of an element can make it harder or easier to interlock with other elements.}

\end{enumerate}

\nnewtext{
In RepulsionPak simulations, we offset the elements outward by $d_\mathrm{gap}/2$ to create element skins (Section~\ref{repulsionpak_preprocessing}).
This allows us to estimate the expected width of negative space which is $d_\mathrm{gap}$ after the simulation stops.
Note that calibrated packings have the same negative space area so they should have the same expected of $d_\mathrm{gap}$.
In a good packing, the gaps of negative space would be close to $d_\mathrm{gap}$.
On the other hand, the gaps in a bad packings would have variations in widths which are smaller or bigger than $d_\mathrm{gap}$.
}


\textbf{Comparison to PAD:} 
Figure~\ref{pad_comparison} compares
RepulsionPak and PAD~\cite{Kwan2016}.  Packing (a) is
a result from the PAD\ paper; Packing (b) was created with RepulsionPak using
the same elements, and calibrated to have the same negative space as~(a).
Note that the PAD\ packing actually has several overlapping elements
(for example, the tooth and the horse), but white haloes around
elements artfully conceal overlaps with little degradation in
visual quality.  Our packing avoids overlaps by design.
The SCP plot in~(c) shows that our packing has a lower value at $d_\mathrm{gap}/2$,
indicating more even negative space, and has a shorter tail,
indicating fewer large empty areas.
Our result also has a histogram bump around $d_\mathrm{gap}/2$, and 
a lower overlap function.

to have the same negative space ratio.
\nnewtext{We visualize the statistics of the PAD packing and the RepulsionPak packing as red curves and blue curves, respectively.}
Our SCP is lower and shorter than the PAD's result,
our histogram shows higher concentration around $d_\mathrm{gap} / 2$,
indicating more even negative space,
and our packing has a lower overlap function.
}
\end{figure}


\textbf{Comparison to an Artist-Made Packing:} 
In Figure~\ref{balabolka_comparison} we show a RepulsionPak result created 
using the elements from the artist-made packing.
Our packing was calibrated to match the artist's.
Looking closely, the artist's packing has a few elements 
separated by narrow gaps, such as the cherries and the corn on the top left.
Our result has fewer large empty gaps, as indicated by a short tail
in its SCP.
Our result also has a histogram bump around $d_\mathrm{gap}/2$, and a lower overlap function.
The result shows the effectiveness of the repulsion forces in successfully
discovering compatibilities in the element boundaries and filling the space effectively.

packing.  Our SCP is lower and shorter than the artist's result,
our histogram shows more concentration around $d_\mathrm{gap} / 2$,
and RepulsionPak also has a lower overlap function.
}
\end{figure}

\textbf{Comparison to Rigid Packings}: 
To evaluate the effect of deformation on negative space, we compute all three metrics under
increasing values of \newtext{$k_\mathrm{edg}$, the edge force relative strength} \newtext{(Section~\ref{repulsionpak_simulation})}.  
\newtext{Note that we only modify the strengths of edge springs and shear springs, 
leaving the strengths of negative space springs unchanged.}
Increasing $k_\mathrm{edg}$
allows the element meshes to resist deformation, ultimately
approximating a rigid packing algorithm.  We created 15 packings,
five for each of three values of $k_\mathrm{edg}$ (5, 250, and 1000).  Each packing
used 25 elements chosen at random from a library of 60, with
no secondary elements.  
All packings are partly calibrated: they all have the same negative
space ratio, but elements are chosen at random and have some
variation in their sizes.
As shown in Figure~\ref{fifteen_packings}, a low value of
$k_\mathrm{edg}$ leads to greater deformation and steeper SCPs.
The more pronounced histogram bump at $r=d_\mathrm{gap}/2$ suggests
more even negative space.
The lower overlap functions indicate fewer narrow gaps between elements.
\newtext{This comparison corresponds to our intuition that edge forces allow us to trade off between element deformation
and evenness of negative space.}

The packings in (a), (b) and (c) are representative results using three values of the edge force strength $k_\mathrm{edg}$,
from rigid ($k_\mathrm{edg}=1000$) to moderate ($k_\mathrm{edg}=250$) to deformable ($k_\mathrm{edg}=5$).
We construct five random packings for each value of $k_\mathrm{edg}$, and plot their SCPs~(d), histograms~(e), and overlap functions~(f).
Packings with the most deformation have steeper and shorter SCPs, 
more histogram concentrations around $d_\mathrm{gap} / 2$, and lower overlap functions.

\newtext{
\nnewtext{We believe} the evenness of negative space is an indicator
of the quality of a packing. 
The more the elements interlock, the more even the negative space.
%we validated our deformation-driven approach 
We evaluated the evenness of negative space
using spherical contact probabilities, histograms of distance transform, and overlap functions.
A packing with a more even negative space has a steeper and shorter SCP, 
more histogram concentrations around $d_\mathrm{gap} / 2$, and a lower overlap function.}

\newtext
{
There are a few ideas that we would like to explore to improve packing evaluation:}
\begin{itemize}

\item \nnewtext{Due to its random initial placement, the evenness of negative space of RepulsionPak results can vary as shown in Figure~\ref{fifteen_packings}.
For each RepulsionPak results in Figure~\ref{pad_comparison} and~\ref{balabolka_comparison}, we run the simulation a few times and choose one that we like.
We would like to improve the comparisons by aggregating data from multiple simulations to reveal the consistency of RepulsionPak.}


\item We would like to conduct experiments that investigate the
extent to which quantitative measurements of the evenness of negative
space in a packing correlate with the human perception of a
packing's quality.  In informal evaluations, some viewers found that
the packing in Figure~\ref{balabolka_comparison}b, created with RepulsionPak,
was packed more tightly than the artist's packing in
Figure~\ref{balabolka_comparison}a, even though both have the same total
amount of negative space.

\item We would like to investigate \newtext{better visualizations for the SCP}.
When comparing calibrated packings, SCPs communicate 
differences in the evenness of negative space, but the differences 
between SCPs can be subtle.  A better visualization
might amplify these differences to make evaluation easier.

\item 
Our metrics are all based on Euclidean distance which is
equivalent to Minkowski sums with discs.
\newtext{With this model of distance, offsets of sharp corners are rounded off. 
Yet, when visually evaluating the evenness of negative space, 
we might implicitly visualize mitered corners as being even, as in the square grid of Figure~\ref{hsr_viz}b. 
It would be worthwhile to investigate statistical measures based on pseudodistance metrics that treat mitering as perceptually even.}

\item
\newtext{In a sense, the local maxima of the distance transform are 
the points that yield the most information about the distribution of negative space: 
any non-maximal point is subordinate to some nearby maximum. 
During this work, we investigated whether we could limit the computation of the distance transform to its local maxima. 
The obvious choice of the medial axis is error-prone, and produces branches in corners that can misrepresent 
the perception of negative space (Figure~\ref{fig_skeleton}). 
The area Voronoi diagram of the elements is promising, but ignores channels bounded by distant parts of the same element. 
More work is needed to identify a geometric skeleton that can serve as a scaffolding for evaluating the distance transform.}

    A medial axis generated from the negative space of the Unilever packing using
    \newtext{the} \mbox{Zhang-Suen} thinning algorithm~\cite{Zhang1984}.
    The medial axis structure can be used to identify local \newtext{maxima} of the distance \newtext{transform}.
    However, \newtext{branches can} touch or nearly touch \newtext{sharp concave corners}, 
    \newtext{and do not correspond to human judgment of negative space}.
