Illustrations of the forces in our simulation.
\;\textbf{(a)~Repulsion force}:
The closest point on the snake's mesh
repels a vertex $\bm{x}$ in the bird mesh.
\textbf{(b)~Edge force}: 
We generate edge forces using
edge springs and auxiliary springs.
\textbf{(c)~Overlap force}: 
Centres of triangles $\bm{p_1}$ and $\bm{p_2}$ attract a vertex
$\bm{x}$ that lies in the interior of another mesh.
\;\textbf{(d)~Boundary force}: A vertex $\bm{x}$ moves toward $\bm{p_b}$,
the closest point on a target container, when it is outside the container.
\textbf{(e)~Torsional force}: We restrict the orientation of the element by generating 
a torsional force at every boundary vertex $\bm{x}$
to restore its angular position relative to $\bm{c}$, 
the center of mass of the element.

  {
  \label{cat_packing}
           A packing of six cat elements inside a fish-shaped target container. 
           Controllable deformation and repulsion forces allow the elements to deform,
           efficiently filling the container and creating a uniform distribution of
           negative space. We then reduce the remaining negative space by placing smaller
           cat heads. The gradient fill was added as a post-process.}

A packing that demonstrates torsional forces.
The packing uses copies of a single element shape, but every copy is given a rest orientation between $0^\circ$
and $180^\circ$, based on its horizontal position in the container.  In the final packing the elements transition
from upright to upside-down, recreating an illusion in which giraffe heads become penguins.}

	{\label{bad_results}
Two demonstrations of how extreme parameter values can lead to
	low-quality results.  In~(a), we allow repulsion to overwhelm element
	shape by setting $k_r$ to 200 and $k_e$ to 20; the resulting packing 
	has even negative space, but elements suffer from high deformation
	and self intersections.  In~(b), we minimize repulsion and prioritize
	orientation by setting $k_e$, $k_t$, and $k_r$ to 200, 100, and 50,
	respectively.  The elements deviate minimally from their original shapes 
	and orientations, but cannot fill the container effectively.
