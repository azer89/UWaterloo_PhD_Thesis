abstract = {Abstract Conventionally, stippling is an effective technique for representing surfaces in pen-and-ink. We present new efficientmethods for stipple drawings by computer. In contrast to already existing techniques, arbitrary shapes canbe used in place of dots. An extension of Lloyd's Method enables us to position small objects on a plane in a visuallypleasing form. This allows us to generate new illustration styles. Similar methods can be used for positioningobjects in other applications.},
