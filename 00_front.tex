\nnewtext{A packing is an arrangement of geometric elements within a container region in the plane.
Elements are united to communicate the overall container shape,
but each is large enough to be appreciated individually.
Creating a packing is challenging since an artist should arrange compatible elements 
so that their boundaries interlock with each other.
This thesis presents three packing methods that create element compatibilities through shape deformation.}
\nnewtext{The first method, FLOWPAK, deforms} elements to flow along a vector field interpolated
from user-supplied strokes, giving a sense of visual flow to the final composition.
\nnewtext{The second method, RepulsionPak, utilizes} repulsion forces to pack
elements, each represented as a mass-spring system, allowing them to deform
to achieve a better fit with their neighbors and the container.
\nnewtext{The last method, AnimationPak, creates} animated packings
by arranging animated two-dimensional elements inside a static
container. We represent animated elements in a three-dimensional
spacetime domain, and view the animated packing problem as a
three-dimensional packing in that domain.
Finally, we propose statistical methods for measuring the evenness of
2D element distributions, which provide quantitative
means of evaluating and comparing packing algorithms.
