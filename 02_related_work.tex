Three popular methods in mosaicing and packings.
%Many mosaicing and packing methods can be grouped into three categories. 
(a) Lloyd's method starts with an initial distribution of elements then iteratively \newtext{displaces} them
to generate a more even packing. 
(b) A data-driven method places elements one by one until the container is filled.
For each step, it \newtext{selects} an element from an element library that is compatible with already placed elements and the container.
(c) A deformation-driven method attempts to create element compatibility through deformation.
The illustrations are adapted from \newtext{The Spectral Approach~\cite{Dalal2006}, 
Pyramid of Arclength Descriptors~\cite{Kwan2016}, and

An element arrangement is defined as a distribution of non-overlapping elements in the plane.
Decades of research in \nnewtext{non-photorealistic rendering (NPR)} have produced many techniques for producing computer-generated element arrangements.
Based on their designs, categories of elements arrangements include
packings, tilings, and discrete textures (Figure~\ref{fig_taxonomy}).
The categorization can be further expanded but we only choose ones that are related to this thesis.
We further break down the packing category into several subcategories: mosaics, 2D packings, 3D packings, 
packings on surfaces, and animated packings.
\newtext{This chapter covers the entire categorization except animated packings, which} are discussed in Chapter~\ref{chapter_animationpak}. 
%Many packing methods discussed in this chapter aim to minimize element overlaps, and
%a few computer-generated packings shown in this chapter 
%contain overlaps to some degree due to the challenge of finding and aligning compatible elements.
Most packing techniques have the goal to generate overlap-free packings, but in reality, it is a difficult task.
A few computer-generated packings shown in this chapter 
contain overlaps to some degree due to the challenge of finding and aligning compatible elements.
}

\newtext
{
\newtext
{Many packing algorithms can also be grouped according to their main algorithmic techniques} (Figure~\ref{fig_taxonomy_method}).
The first category, Lloyd's method, iteratively refines an initial element arrangement to generate a more even distribution.
The second category, data-driven methods, places elements one by one. For each step,
an element is taken from an element library that is compatible with previously placed elements and the container boundary.
The last category, deformation-driven methods, attempts to create element compatibilities through shape deformation.

\section{Mosaics}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\newtext
{
Mosaics are 2D arrangements that are popular for decorating floors or walls.
In traditional mosaics, elements are made of stone, ceramics, or glass.
The majority of these mosaicing techniques use \newtext{Lloyd's} method to distribute elements
via rigid transformations (Figure~\ref{fig_taxonomy_method}a).
Originally, Lloyd's method \newtext{was introduced in computer graphics} by \mbox{McCool} and Fiume to distribute point elements~\cite{McCool1992}.
\newtext{It was later} generalized to distribute convex and concave elements.
}

\newtext
{
We first discuss the simplest variant of Lloyd's method that distributes point elements, 
as shown in Figure~\ref{fig_lloyds_method}.}
\newtext{Given $N$ point elements, we first compute a \textit{Voronoi diagram} that partitions the plane into $N$ regions such that
all points inside a Voronoi cell are closest to its associated point element.
Lloyd's method moves every point element to the centroid of its Voronoi cell, 
then the Voronoi diagram is recomputed.
The process is repeated until the distribution is even,
\newtext{meaning that} the point elements are located at the centroids of the Voronoi cells.
The final structure is called a \textit{centroidal Voronoi diagram} (CVD).
}

\newtext{When computing centroids, a standard CVD assumes the area density is uniform everywhere.}
\newtext{Secord~\cite{Secord2002} computed a weighted CVD so that the resulting point element distribution
resembles a stippling artwork (Figure~\ref{fig_related_secord_hausner}a).}
\newtext{His method incorporates the pixel intensities of an input image to construct \newtext{a density function}. 
This alters the centroid calculation so that point elements are attracted to \newtext{darker regions}.}

\newtext{A standard CVD is generated using Euclidean distance, but other metrics lead to different shapes of Voronoi cells.
Hausner~\cite{Hausner2001}} \newtext{simulated the appearance of traditional mosaics by using} 
\newtext{Manhattan distance, producing Voronoi cells that resemble squares instead of hexagons.
Each Voronoi cell is then replaced with a square element and the resulting arrangement
resembles the appearance of traditional mosaics (Figure~\ref{fig_related_secord_hausner}b). 
However, a standard CVD computes only the positions of the square elements, and Hausner must
\nnewtext{incorporate} a vector field to modify the orientation of the metric
and rotate the square elements. 
Additionally, the approach is only suitable for square elements as
more complicated shapes, such as long rectangles, would have severe overlaps.}
\newtext{More recently, Doyle et al.~\cite{Doyle2019} and Javid et al.~\cite{Javid2019} generated pebble mosaics 
using a superpixel image segmentation~\cite{Achanta2012}, which is a variant \newtext{of} Lloyd's method that \newtext{blends an} Euclidean metric \newtext{with} a CIELAB colour metric.
They later elongated the Voronoi cells to follow the gradient of the input image, 
and smoothed out the cell boundaries. 
The resulting Voronoi cells resemble smooth elongated pebble shapes.

}
\end{figure}

\newtext{We now discuss the computation of Voronoi diagrams that is generalized 
to any shapes for which a distance measurement exists.} 
\newtext
{Hiller et al.~\cite{Hiller2003} extended Lloyd's method to construct \textit{centroidal area Voronoi diagrams} (CAVDs),
a variant of CVDs that \newtext{yields} a distribution of polygonal elements.
This new extension computes the main inertial axis for each Voronoi cell so that 
its element can be rotated to achieve better alignment with the Voronoi cell boundary.
In follow up work, Smith et al.~\cite{Smith2005} developed Animosaics to generate temporally coherent animated mosaics by utilizing CAVDs.
Dalal et al.~\cite{Dalal2006} proposed a spectral approach based on a fast Fourier transform to reposition
elements so that they achieve the best alignments with their Voronoi cell boundaries, 
which could be seen as making more effective use of negative
space, and permitting non-convex elements to interlock more than they did in
earlier methods.}
\newtext{However, the spectral approach cannot rotate the elements,
so it resorts to a brute force approach to find the best orientation.
Just like Animosaics, the spectral approach can generate animated mosaics,
a topic that we will explore further in Chapter~\ref{chapter_animationpak}.}

\newtext{As an alternative to Lloyd's method, an interactive user interface can also be used to generate mosaics.
Abdrashitov et al.~\cite{Abdrashitov2014} developed
a sketch-based \newtext{mosaic} interface where an artist can draw curves \newtext{to guide the placement of square-like elements.}
After the square elements are frozen in place, 
their boundaries are sliced to eliminate overlaps. }

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%\nnewtext
%{
%This section discusses related methods that generate 2D mosaics or packings,
%which are about arranging 2D elements tightly in a 2D container.
%Both mosaics and packings have a similar goal of creating a composition that have even distribution while minimizing overlaps.
%A packing with an even distribution has its positive and negative space approximately uniform.
%The gaps between elements should roughly have the same width.
%Visually, traditional mosaics often use near convex elements made of stone, ceramics, or glass,
%while 2D packings are composed of elements that have more general 
%shapes that are either convex or concave.
%}

%\nnewtext{
%An approach to generate a packing is to start with an initial configuration and 
%iteratively refine it using \textit{Lloyd's method}~\cite{McCool1992}.}
%\newtext{
%Figure~\ref{fig_lloyds_method} shows an illustration of point-based Lloyd's method.

%Hausner~\cite{Hausner2001} used this idea to distribute square elements into a container

\section{2D Packings}

\newtext{
This section discusses packings composed of elements that resemble 
man-made objects, geometry, letterforms, plants, or animals.
Unlike decorative mosaics, 
packings are mostly found in logo design and graphic design.
Some packing styles are reminiscent \newtext{to paintings by Giuseppe Arcimboldo, 
like the one} shown in Figure ~\ref{fig_related_arcimboldo}.
Most packing methods drift away from Lloyd's method in favor of data-driven methods (Figure~\ref{fig_taxonomy_method}b) and 
deformation-driven methods (Figure~\ref{fig_taxonomy_method}c).}

%\nnewtext
%{
%This section discusses packing methods that fall into the categories of data-driven (Figure~\ref{fig_taxonomy_method}b) and 
%deformation-driven (Figure~\ref{fig_taxonomy_method}c).
%Unlike mosaics, these packings are composed of 
%more intricate elements that resemble man-made objects, letterforms, plants, or animals.
%Additionally, some packing styles are reminiscent to one of Giuseppe Arcimboldo's paintings 
%shown in Figure ~\ref{fig_related_arcimboldo}).
%}

\newtext{A data-driven method requires an input element library to find compatible elements (Figure~\ref{fig_related_jim_pad}).}
\newtext{\newtext{Typically, elements are placed} one by one until the container area is filled.
A shape matching algorithm selects an 
element from the library that has the best compatibility with the previously placed elements or the container boundary.
Jigsaw Image Mosaics \nnewtext{(JIM)}~\cite{Kim2002} uses a geometric hashing technique to find
compatible elements. \newtext{JIM} places elements using a greedy approach, but is able to backtrack 
if a previous configuration is more optimal.
Pyramid of Arclength Descriptor (PAD)~\cite{Kwan2016} is a curvature-based shape descriptor that
can find new elements that partially match
existing element boundaries as a container \newtext{is} being filled. }


\newtext{\newtext{An alternative approach to data-driven methods} is to initially partition a container into smaller segments
\newtext{and} independently replace each segment with a matching element \newtext{taken from the library}.
This is desirable if the container has colours or salient parts that need to be emphasized.
Huang et al.~\cite{Huang2011} proposed a data-driven approach that generates Arcimboldo-like collages
by arranging cutout images collected from the internet.
Their container is a larger cutout image which is partitioned into parts
using an image segmentation algorithm.
Each part is then replaced with a smaller cutout image that has a similar shape and colour.
}

\newtext
{
All these data-driven methods require a large element library.
The more elements in the library, the better the chances of finding compatible elements.}
\newtext
{
For example, \newtext{JIM} required about 900 elements, PAD used a library with more than 120 elements 
(see Figure~\ref{fig_taxonomy_method}), 
and Huang et al.\ needed about 5000 elements.}
\newtext
{However, a bigger database means increased \newtext{computation time} and
collecting a large number of elements is not always feasible.}


%Techniques like JIM and PAD pack elements without deforming them. 
%But element shapes never have perfectly compatible boundaries, and the packing process allows some overlaps to arise between neighbouring elements. 
%These techniques optionally post-process elements by locally deforming their boundaries to suppress overlaps.  
%While these local adjustments improve compatibility, 
%they cannot interact with the placement process, and 
%a large element library is still required to generate satisfactory 

\newtext{ 
The placement process in JIM and PAD is being done without shape deformation.

These techniques optionally post-process elements by locally deforming their boundaries to suppress overlaps.  
While these local adjustments improve compatibility, 
they cannot influence the placement process, and 
a large element library is still required to generate satisfactory packings.
}

%\nnewtext{ 
%After the container is filled, these data-driven methods permit some elements to overlaps,
%which are later corrected using deformation.
%This is a post-processing step where the elements are frozen in place and
%the deformation is applied locally near element boundaries.
%The deformation improves element compatibilities, 
%but only locally as these methods still need a large element library to generate satisfactory packings.}

{
Instead of allowing shape compatibilities to arise organically in a large collection of elements, 
we can deform elements to manufacture those compatibilities.
A deformation-driven method can create packings based on much smaller element libraries.
Xu and Kaplan~\cite{Xu2007} and Zou et al.~\cite{Zou2016} constructed calligraphic packings by filling a container with a small
number of letter elements composing one or two words (Figure~\ref{fig_taxonomy_method}c and ~\ref{fig_calligraphy_packing}a). 
Xu and Kaplan's method is able to fill the container but 
\newtext{the arrangement and deformation of the letters can make the calligram difficult to read}.
The improved method by Zou et al. can achieve better readability by computing
the medial axis of the container where letter elements are anchored.
However, these calligraphic packing methods require significant deformation 
so they are not able to preserve the \newtext{characters of the original letterforms}.
\newtext{In other work}, 
Peng et al.~\cite{Peng2014} proposed a method that packs and deforms
simple polygon and polyomino elements to generate layouts for urban planning or indoor space, 
although their method cannot handle more complicated element shapes. 
An example of a generated indoor layout is \newtext{shown} in Figure~\ref{fig_office}.
}


\newtext
{
These data-driven methods and deformation driven methods inspire \newtext{us} to develop new packing methods.
%We see an opportunity to develop better packing methods that combine 
%the best of both worlds of data-driven methods and deformation driven methods.
In JIMs and PAD packings, deformation is a \newtext{post-processing operation used for local touch-ups}.
In \newtext{calligraphic} packings and polyomino layouts, the deformation methods are limited to specific element shapes.
We would like to use deformation as the core of the packing process and generate \newtext{packings}
with more general styles similar to JIMs and PAD packings.

\section{Tilings}
\label{related_wrok_tiling}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\newtext
{
As elements reach perfect compatibility, a packing turns \nnewtext{into} a tiling, \newtext{such as the example} in Figure~\ref{fig_related_escherization}a.
The element boundaries interlock, leaving no negative space.
\newtext{Kaplan and Salesin introduced Escherization~\cite{Kaplan2000, Kaplan2004},
a technique that deforms} one or two 
input elements into shapes that can tile the plane.
The tiles always fill the entire plane, and are not intended for filling a bounded container.}
\newtext{Given an input \newtext{element $S$}, they performed a search in a parameterized tiling space to find its
deformed variant $T$.
Due to deformation,}
\newtext{$T$ is often perceptually unrecognizable from its silhouette unless an interior picture is added.}
\newtext{
Kaplan and Salesin's method has a better chance to find $T$ if \newtext{$S$} has shallow concavities.
More recent methods~\cite{Koizumi2011, Nagata2020} are able to solve the Escherization problem more efficiently and can deal with shapes 
that have deeper concavities.}


%Given an input element $E$ they look for a similar tileable element $T$
%in a parameterized tiling space using simulated annealing.
%The original heuristic method has a better chance to find $T$ if $E$ has less concavity, but more recent methods
%are able to tile shapes 
%The original heuristic method can only deal withfail to find $T$ if $E$ has deep concavity, for example, a ``G'' shape.
%However, more recent methods are able to deal with this issue.

\newtext
{
Past research has proposed methods
to replicate the figure-ground reversal style of Escher's 
\newtext{\textit{Sky and Water}},
in which elements serve as both positive and negative space depending 
on the viewer's perception~\cite{Kaplan2004, Sugihara2009, Lin2018}.
\newtext{Two input elements $S_1$ and $S_2$ are placed at opposite ends of a canvas.
They are then copied, arranged, and deformed until they meet in a tiling in the middle, with copies of each shape acting as the other's negative space
(Figure~\ref{fig_related_escherization}b).
\deadtext{The gradual evolution of tile shapes can also be found in Escher-like metamorphoses and Parquet Deformations. 
As shown in Figure~\ref{fig_related_escherization}c, tilings that can be interpreted as a kind of spatial animation.}}
\nnewtext{The gradual evolution of tile shapes can also be found in Parquet Deformations, a graphic design style invented by William Huff~\cite{Hofstadter1986}.
Aesthetically, Parquet Deformation is closely related to Escher's metamorphoses.
An example can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig_related_escherization}c, where tilings that can be interpreted as a kind of spatial animation.}
Kaplan~\cite{Kaplan2010} proposed several element evolution schemes\deadtext{ to generate \newtext{metamorphoses}}:
a grid-based curve evolution, iterated function systems, and organic labyrinth simulations.

\section{Discrete Texture Synthesis}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%



\newtext
{
Some past work has sought to adapt example-based texture synthesis methods
from raster images to vector graphics, producing distributions of
rigidly transformed elements that mimic the statistics of an \textit{exemplar}, 
an example can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig_discrete_texture}.}
\newtext{For raster-based texture synthesis methods, readers can refer to a survey paper
compiled by Wei et al.~\cite{Wei2009}.}
\newtext{These techniques are all concerned with replicating
the distribution of positive space in the exemplar, and less about negative space.}
\newtext{An element is represented as a single point, which is adequate for small near-convex elements.
Barla et al.~\cite{Barla2006} and Ijiri et al.~\cite{Ijiri2008} used a growth model that copies small neighbourhoods
from the exemplar into a larger output texture.  
Hurtut et al.~\cite{Hurtut2009} developed a statistical sampling method based
on multitype point processes.  
AlMeraj et al.~\cite{AlMeraj2013}
stamped out copies of the exemplar and discarded overlapping elements.
Loi et al.~\cite{Loi2017} developed a texture synthesis method that
can specify global arrangements, local arrangements, or a blend of multiple arrangements.
}

\newtext
{
For larger concave elements, a single point representation is not enough.
Ma et al. ~\cite{Ma2011} used a sample-based representation that
is created by generating a sparse set of points inside an element.
They later distributed these points using a neighbourhood metric and an iterative optimization.
Unlike previous work, they \nnewtext{were able to synthesize} textures with long deformable elements, for example, spaghetti.
Ma et al. later extended their work to accept animated elements~\cite{Ma2013}, where
each sample point has a spatial and time position, turning the problem to spacetime texture synthesis.
More recently, Hsu et al.~\cite{Hsu2020} adapted the sample-based representation into an interactive tool
where an artist can initially distribute elements by drawing strokes
which are then optimized using a Lloyd-like optimization.

\newtext{Collages are arrangements of overlapping elements, similar to
portrait paintings by Giuseppe Arcimboldo.
Gal et al.~\cite{Gal2007B} presented a method for constructing 3D
collages \newtext{(Figure~\ref{fig_related_gal_ma_chen}a)}.  
They filled a 3D container with overlapping 3D elements using a greedy
approach and a partial shape matching algorithm.}

\newtext
{
The cutting and packing problem (C\&P) is defined as cutting a large object into smaller parts 
which are then packed inside a container.
C\&P is popular in manufacturing and 3D printing because
objects can be produced with less waste material and packed into a smaller box.
A good cutting process is critical in C\&P: if it can decompose the input object
into simpler parts, then the packing process can be easier.
Chernov et al.~\cite{Chernov2010} proposed a method to decompose a large object
into smaller ``phi objects'' that can be packed more efficiently.
A phi object is defined as a shape whose surface boundaries 
are flat, spherical, cylindrical, or conical.
Vanek et al.~\cite{Vanek2014} introduced PackMerger,
a method to pack thin shells which can be assembled together into
a larger watertight object.
In follow up work, Chen et al.~\cite{Chen2015} introduced Dapper,
a method to cut and pack volumetric printed objects.
}

\newtext
{
In engineering, packings are useful for a number of applications, 
such as product packaging, circuit designs, or mechanical layouts.
This requires elements to be packed without any overlap.
Cagan et al.~\cite{Cagan2002} compiled a survey of 3D packing approaches such as
gradient methods, simulated annealing, and genetic algorithms.
Byholm et al.~\cite{Byholm2009} developed a method
to pack voxelized elements, which are computationally easier for collision detection.

\section{Packings on Surfaces}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Some recent work has explored the elaboration of ornamental
patterns on surfaces, under constraints imposed by fabrication, such as connectivity.  
\newtext{Schiftner et al.~\cite{Schiftner2009} introduced Circle Packing meshes,
a special kind of triangle mesh,
where the incircles of two neighbouring triangles have the same contact point on the shared edge,
forming a packing of circles or spheres.}
Chen et al.~\cite{Chen2016} developed a method to generate a filigree pattern,
which is an arrangement of decorative thin rod elements on a surface.
Given an initial random configuration of overlapping elements, their method
removes overlaps by either deforming or trimming the rods.
In similar work, Zehnder et al.~\cite{Zehnder2016} 
proposed a semi-automated tool for deforming ornamental curves to cover a surface, \newtext{as} shown in 
Figure~\ref{fig_related_gal_ma_chen}c. 
They \newtext{start} with an \nnewtext{initial, overlap-free} configuration of scaled down elements. 
They \newtext{then grow} the elements, \newtext{avoiding} overlaps using curve deformation.
Chen et al.~\cite{Chen2017} generated modular surfaces by
computing contact point networks of rigid elements, \newtext{as shown} in Figure~\ref{fig_related_gal_ma_chen}d.
Bian et al.~\cite{Bian2018} used Wang tiles made of element parts to generate filigree patterns.
Mart\'{\i}nez et al.~\cite{Martinez2019} developed \newtext{a variant of Lloyd's method} to generate
star-shaped tiling patterns that are printed onto tracery sheets.
Their method works by constructing a star-shaped metric to manipulate the Voronoi cell shapes.
