\mynote{
\begin{itemize}
\item More than a literature review
\item Organize related work - impose structure
\item Be clear as to how previous work being described relates to your own. This is not just a list of the related work, you must describe how it is related. How is similar? How is it different?
\item The reader should not be left wondering why you've described something!!
\item Critique the existing work - Where is it strong where is it weak? What are the unreasonable/undesirable assumptions?
\item Identify opportunities for more research (i.e., your thesis) Are there unaddressed, or more important related topics?
\item After reading this chapter, one should understand the motivation for and importance of your thesis
\item You should clearly and precisely define all of the key concepts dealt with in the rest of the thesis, and teach the reader what s/he needs to know to understand the rest of the thesis.
\end{itemize}
