\begin{itemize}
\item State what you've done and what you've found
\item Summarize contributions (achievements and impact)
\item Outline open issues/directions for future work
\end{itemize}
}

\begin{itemize}
\item We present deformation driven methods for packing elements.
\item FLOWPAK is a method to pack long thin elements using iterative optimization.
\item RepulsionPak is a packing method that demonstrates deformation-driven packings.
\item AnimationPak is an extension of RepulsionPak
to create packings of elements with scripted animations.
\item We propose metrics to evaluate the evenness of negative space.
\end{itemize}
