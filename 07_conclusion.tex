\section{Conclusions}

\newtext
{
We presented three deformation-driven packing methods.
FLOWPAK is a method to deform and pack long thin elements to follow a vector field.
RepulsionPak is a method that uses repulsion forces to pack and deform
elements that are represented as mass-spring systems.
AnimationPak is an extension of RepulsionPak that packs animated 2D elements,
each is an extruded 3D shape in a spacetime domain.
}

\newtext
{
Given a small size element library, 
we demonstrated that deformation-driven methods can create element compatibilities
and fill the container effectively.
Repeated elements give a sense of uniformity but deformation creates a sense of variety.
%As element compatibilities are increased, the negative space is more even.
}

\newtext
{
We discussed that the evenness of negative space is an indicator of the quality of a packing.
We measured the evenness using three statistical metrics:
spherical contact probabilities, histograms of distance transforms, and overlap functions.
}

\section{Future Work}

{
We see many possibilities for packing research.

\subsection{Element Manufacturing}

\nnewtext{If we cannot find a compatible element, maybe we just have to create it.
The goal is to manufacture a new element on the fly that is compatible with the container and the neighboring elements.
A simple example is demonstrated in a FLOWPAK result (Figure~\ref{result_bear_offset}), 
where new elements are created from the unused negative space.
A manufactured elements is also useful to create fixed elements (Chapter~\ref{chapter_flowpak}).}
This can be done perhaps by discovering them as salient regions 
in source photographs, and extracting and vectorizing them.  This 
extraction must be carried out carefully, yielding enough fixed elements
to communicate a container clearly without disrupting the uniformity of
the design.

\nnewtext{Another idea is to manufacture \textit{modular} elements assembled from smaller subparts.
A modular element can increase its compatibility by swapping its subparts.
Data-driven methods can benefit from this approach as we are able to 
generate large amount of possible elements from a collection of subparts.
We can also work toward uniformity amidst variety principle 
as we can generate similar elements with varying subparts.}

\nnewtext{We consider an idea of modular elements in ornamental packings with flow visual style.
In Figure~\ref{thread_branch}a, we can
combine multiple shorter elements with spines
by threading them to create a longer modular element.
In Figure~\ref{thread_branch}b, we can also
try to generate branching structures to resemble floral ornaments.
On both element threading and branching, there are several challenges we have to face.
First, we need a way to connect the overlapping segments of the elements together
to create smooth and plausible transitions.
An ornament synthesis method such as DecoBrush~\cite{Lu2014} may be worth investigating.
This possibly leads us to a deeper research topic:
how to develop a content-aware blending method on vector graphics patterns.
Second, we also should consider the semantics of the element shapes.
Not every part of an element can be connected; for example, a twig
cannot be attached onto the tip of a leaf.}

\nnewtext{Another example of modular elements are shown in Figure~\ref{modular_element}.
The goal is create unique elements that can maximize compatibility.
We would like to investigate several shape synthesis methods by 
Risser et al.~\cite{Risser2010}, Kalogerakis et al.~\cite{Kalogerakis2012}, and Hurtut and Landes~\cite{Hurtut2012}. 
Modular elements provide us opportunities to perform a better element placement.
The first idea is similar to JIM method,
but we are able to backtrack to previous arrangements 
that have not only different elements but also different parts.
The second idea is to perform partial shape matching only between salient container features and
element subparts. Once a matching subpart is attached to a salient feature, we can then manufacture an entire
element based on that subpart.}

\subsection{Collaborations with Artists}

Collaborations with artists can benefit us for many ways,
such as performing qualitative analysis or developing a new packing method.

\newtext{\textbf{User Study with Artists:}}
There are many examples of static two-dimensional packings
	created by artists, which can serve as inspiration for an algorithm like RepulsionPak.  
	We were only able to find a single example of animated packing from The Simpsons (Figure~\ref{fig_animationpak_lisa_packing}). 
	We think its unpopularity is because it is difficult and time-consuming to create by hand.
	\newtext{Therefore,} we would like to engage with artists to understand the aesthetic value and limitations
	of AnimationPak.

\newtext{\textbf{Evaluating 2D Animated Packings:}}
All three metrics are only for evaluating 2D packings.
  While they extend naturally to three purely spatial
  dimensions, it is not clear whether they can be 
  adapted to the spacetime context.  
  We would like to investigate
  spatial statistics for the quality of animated packings created by AnimationPak that correlate
  with human perceptual judgments.

\newtext{\textbf{Human Perception of the Evenness:}} We would like to conduct experiments that investigate the
  extent to which quantitative measurements of the evenness of negative
  space in a packing correlate with the human perception of a
  packing's quality.  In informal evaluations, some viewers found that
  the packing in Figure~\ref{balabolka_comparison}b, created with RepulsionPak,
  was packed more tightly than the artist's packing in
  Figure~\ref{balabolka_comparison}a, even though both have the same total
  amount of negative space.

\newtext{\textbf{Measuring Other Design Principles:}} We would like to develop additional metrics to evaluate
  how well an ornamental design fulfills other design principles.
  A measure of element deformation in a composition would permit 
  a comparison against future deformation-driven techniques.
  \newtext{In Chapter~\ref{chapter_flowpak}, we argue that visual flow and
  ``uniformity amidst variety'' are important to attractive packings.} 
  In another study, Wong et al.~\cite{Wong1998} describe basic design
  principles for decorative arts: repetition, balance, and conformation
  to geometric constraints.  The rigorous expression of aesthetic principles
  is a fascinating area for future research.

bas-reliefs give us an idea to generate a packing of 3D objects on a 2D panel,
or we call it as a 2.5D packing.
Individual element can still rotate in 3D to align itself with its neighbors.

\end{figure}



\subsection{RepulsionPak}

%We see many possibilities for further improvements to RepulsionPak
%and future research on element packings.

\begin{itemize}

\item \newtext{\textbf{RepulsionPak for Fabrication:}} 
We would like to explore the use of RepulsionPak in a fabrication context.
      For example, our boundary compatibilities might be used to create a connected object.
      Alternatively, it would be interesting to 3D print the 
      negative space, which is already connected,
	  leaving holes that surround the element shapes.


\item \newtext{\textbf{Interactive Packings:}
  We would like to develop human-in-the-loop interactions, in
  which the user and the computer work together to create a desired
  composition.  Examples of recent work in this style include research
  by Zehnder et al.~\cite{Zehnder2016}, Gieseke et
  al.~\cite{Gieseke2017}, and Hsu et al.~\cite{Hsu2020}, which let the user directly place and manipulate
  elements while a composition is being created.
  It would also be interesting to display an interactive packing on a large touch screen,
  and let people to move elements around by touching and dragging gestures.}

\end{itemize}

\subsection{AnimationPak}

%We see an number of opportunities for improvements and extensions to
%AnimationPak:

\begin{itemize}

\item \newtext{\textbf{Deformation-Driven 3D Packings:}}
AnimationPak implements forces and constraints geared towards 
	spacetime animation, but many of the same ideas could be adapted
	to develop a deformation-driven method for packing purely spatial
	3D objects into a 3D container.  We would like to evaluate the
	expressivity and visual quality of deformation-driven 3D packings 
	in comparison to other 3D packing techniques.



\end{itemize}
