\section{Conclusions}

\newtext
{
We presented three deformation-driven packing methods.
FLOWPAK is a method to deform and pack long thin elements to follow a vector field.
RepulsionPak is a method that uses repulsion forces to pack and deform
elements that are represented as mass-spring systems.
AnimationPak is an extension of RepulsionPak that packs animated 2D elements,
each an extruded 3D shape in a spacetime domain.
}

\newtext
{
Given a small size element library, 
we demonstrated that deformation-driven methods can create element compatibilities
and fill the container effectively.
Repeated elements give a sense of uniformity but deformation creates a sense of variety.
%As element compatibilities are increased, the negative space is more even.
}

\newtext
{
We discussed that the evenness of negative space is an indicator of the quality of a packing.
We measured the evenness using three statistical metrics:
spherical contact probabilities, histograms of distance transforms, and overlap functions.
}

\section{Future Work}

\newtext
{
This thesis in only the tip of the iceberg of packing research as
we see many possibilities for future work.

\subsection{Element Manufacturing}

\nnewtext{If we cannot find a compatible element, we just have to create it.
We would like to manufacture a new element on the fly that is compatible with the container and the neighboring elements.
A simple example is demonstrated in a FLOWPAK result (Figure~\ref{result_bear_offset}), 
where new elements are created from the unused negative space.
A manufactured element is also useful to create a fixed element (Chapter~\ref{chapter_flowpak}).}
This can be done perhaps by discovering them as salient regions 
in source photographs, and extracting and vectorizing them.  This 
extraction must be carried out carefully, yielding enough fixed elements
to communicate a container clearly without disrupting the uniformity of
the design.

\nnewtext{Another idea is to manufacture \textit{modular} elements assembled from smaller subparts.
A modular element can increase its compatibility by swapping its subparts.
Data-driven methods can benefit from this approach as we are able to 
generate large combinations of elements from a collection of subparts.
We can also work toward uniformity amidst variety principle 
as we can generate similar elements with varying subparts.}

\nnewtext{Another example of modular elements are shown in Figure~\ref{modular_element}.
The goal is create unique elements that can maximize compatibility.
We would like to investigate several shape synthesis methods by 
Baxter and Anjyo~\cite{Baxter2006},
Risser et al.~\cite{Risser2010}, Kalogerakis et al.~\cite{Kalogerakis2012}, 
and Hurtut and Landes~\cite{Hurtut2012}. 
This style of modular element provides us opportunities to perform a better element placement.
The first idea is similar to JIM method,
but we are able to backtrack to previous arrangements 
that have not only different elements but also different parts.
The second idea is to perform partial shape matching only between salient container features and
element subparts. Once a matching subpart is attached to a salient feature, we can then manufacture an entire
element based on that subpart.}

\nnewtext{We consider an idea of plant-style modular elements.
In Figure~\ref{thread_branch}a, we can
combine multiple shorter elements with spines
by threading them to create a longer modular element.
In Figure~\ref{thread_branch}b, we can also
try to generate branching structures to resemble floral ornaments.
In both instances, there are several challenges we have to face.
First, we need a way to connect the overlapping segments of the elements together
to create smooth and plausible transitions.
An ornament synthesis method such as DecoBrush~\cite{Lu2014} may be worth investigating
although it uses pixel-based blending.
This leads us to a deeper research topic:
how to develop a content-aware blending method on vector graphics patterns.
Second, we also should consider the semantics of the element shapes.
Not every part of an element can be connected; for example, a twig
cannot be attached onto the tip of a leaf.}

\subsection{Collaborations with Artists}

We would like develop an interactive user interfaces for our packing methods.
Examples of recent work in this style include research
by Zehnder et al.~\cite{Zehnder2016}, Gieseke et al.~\cite{Gieseke2017}, 
and Hsu et al.~\cite{Hsu2020}, which let the user directly place and manipulate
elements while a composition is being created.
\nnewtext{It would also be interesting to display an interactive packing on a large touch screen,
and let artist to move around gesturally.}

In the context of animated packings, 
We were only able to find a single example from The Simpsons (Figure~\ref{fig_animationpak_lisa_packing}). 
We think its unpopularity is because it is difficult and time-consuming to create by hand.
Therefore, we would like to engage with artists to understand the aesthetic value and limitations
of AnimationPak.

\subsection{Beyond 2D Packings}

We would like to explore the use of deformation-driven methods in a fabrication context.
Specifically, we want to pack 2D elements on surfaces.
For example, our boundary compatibilities might be used to create a connected object.
Alternatively, it would be interesting to 3D print the 
negative space, which is already connected due to the absence of overlap.
The resulting packing is the shape of negative space with holes from element shapes.

Many of the techniques in this thesis could be adapted
to develop a deformation-driven method for packing purely spatial
3D objects in a 3D container.  
We would like to evaluate the
expressivity and visual quality of deformation-driven 3D packings 
in comparison to other 3D packing techniques.

In a general 3D packing, elements in the middle may be fully occluded by their neighbors,
which would render them useless as they cannot be viewed.
This problem will arise especially in a dense 3D packing of small elements.
An interesting idea would be generating bas-reliefs using packing methods.
We can also call this as 2.5D packings.
Figure~\ref{borobudur} shows a two bas-reliefs from Borobudur temple, Indonesia.
Each relief consists of tight arrangement of human shapes although it does not 
have interlocking style of packings.
We see this problem as arranging 3D elements on surfaces, 
which include not only 2D panels but also any 3D surfaces.
Each 3D element can still rotate in all three axes but still attached to the surface.
It would also be interesting to investigate the aesthetics of 2.5D packing of non-overlapping
3D elements but contain occlusions as seen in Figure~\ref{borobudur}.

\subsection{Packing Evaluation}

We would like to develop additional metrics to evaluate
how well an ornamental design fulfills other design principles.
\newtext{In Chapter~\ref{chapter_flowpak}, we argue that visual flow and
``uniformity amidst variety'' are important in attractive packings.} 
In another study, Wong et al.~\cite{Wong1998} describe basic design
principles for decorative arts: repetition, balance, and conformation
to geometric constraints. 

A measure of element deformation in a composition would permit 
a comparison against future deformation-driven techniques.
In RepulsionPak, we can measure the potential energy at equilibrum.
However, there are some questions to answer.
Can we measure how easily deformations are perceived? How much they affect the aesthetics of packings?
Such measurements could help us develop better deformation algorithms in generally, not just in the context of packings.
%Can we measure how much deformation has happened (RepulsionPak: measure the potential energy left in the system at equilibrium?).  Can we measure how easily deformations are perceived, how much they affect the aesthetics of packings? In the long run, such measurements could help us develop better deformation algorithms more generally, not just in the context of packings.

All three metrics described in Chapter~\ref{chapter_qualitative_metrics} are only for evaluating 2D packings.
While they extend naturally to three purely spatial
dimensions, it is not clear whether they can be 
adapted to the spacetime context.  
We would like to investigate spatial statistics for the quality of animated packings created by AnimationPak that correlate
with human perceptual judgments.
