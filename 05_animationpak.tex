%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Animated packings are a largely unexplored style
of motion graphics, presumably because of the difficulty of creating 
an animated packing by hand.  We were not able to find any motivating
examples created by artists.  There is also very little past research
on animated packings; we discuss the work that does exist in the next
section.

{\label{fig_discretization} 
The creation of a discretized spacetime element.  
(a) A 2D element shape offset by $\Delta s$.
(b) A single triangle mesh slice.
(c) Shear edges (red) and negative space edges (blue).
(d) A set of five slices placed along the time axis.
(e) The vertices on the boundaries of the slices are joined by 
	time edges.  The black edges in~(e) define a triangle mesh
	called the envelope of the element.
	In practice we use a larger number of slices in~(d) and~(e).
